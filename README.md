# SeatYourself

Bitmaker project.

SeatYourself is a clone of OpenTable, an online reservation booking service which allows diners to find restaurants in their area based upon location, price, cuisine and availability.

This assignment is to recreate this application. Among the challenges will be more in-depth associations and testing first. This also involves practice with User Stories, Mockups, and Entity-relationship modelling.
